# GENC â€” CLI file encryption tool

GENC is a command line file encryption tool written in GoLang. It provides strong encryption via AES-256 and uses PBKDF2 SHA-512 (1 048 576 iterations, 384 bit salt) to derive keys from passwords.

## Features

- Single file encryption/decryption
- Recursive directory encryption/decryption
- Optional additional prompting to hide passwords from command line history (enabled by default)
- Autodelete

## Installation

1. Make sure you have GoLang installed
2. Clone the repository via `git clone https://github.com/wachttijd/genc`
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Build GENC using `go build .`
5. Try it by running the resulting binary with the `-h` flag!

## Usage

### Encrypting a single file

```
genc -m E -t file_to_encrypt.txt
```

Then you will be asked for a password.
After successful encryption GENC will print something like this:

```
Encryption succeeded.
file_to_encrypt.txt --> file_to_encrypt.txt.genc
```

You can also use `-d` to delete `file_to_encrypt.txt` after encryption.

### Decrypting a single file

```
genc -m D -t file_to_decrypt.txt.genc
```

You will be asked for a password.
Output will be like:

```
Decrypted.
file_to_decrypt.txt.genc --> file_to_decrypt.txt
```

### Encrypting/decrypting a directory

There are no special command line flags for directory encryption.
Just pass a directory as a target. GENC is able to distinguish a directory from a file by itself.

```
genc -m E -t directory_to_encrypt
```

and to decrypt:

```
genc -m D -t directory_to_encrypt
```

### Autodelete

You can use `-d` flag to delete original files after encryption or encrypted ones after decryption.

### Passing password as a command line flag

**Unsafe since password may remain in the command line history.**

```
genc -m E -t file.txt -p password
```
